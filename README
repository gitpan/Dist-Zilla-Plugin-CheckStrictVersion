NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CheckStrictVersion - BeforeRelease plugin to check
    for a strict version number

VERSION
    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS
    In your dist.ini file:

        [CheckStrictVersion]
        decimal_only = 1

DESCRIPTION
    This module enforces strict versions, with optional enforcement of
    'decimal' or 'tuple' (a.k.a 'dotted decimal') forms.

    As a reminder, here are the rules for strict versions from
    version::Internals:

        v1.234.5
            For dotted-decimal versions, a leading 'v' is required, with three
            or more sub-versions of no more than three digits. A leading 0
            (zero) before the first sub-version (in the above example, '1') is
            also prohibited.

        2.3456
            For decimal versions, an integer portion (no leading 0), a decimal
            point, and one or more digits to the right of the decimal are all
            required.

ATTRIBUTES
  decimal_only
    If true, only a decimal (non-tuple) version is allowed. Default is
    false.

  tuple_only
    If true, only a tuple (a.k.a. 'dotted-decimal') version is allowed.
    Default is false.
